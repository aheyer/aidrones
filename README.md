A documentation about designing, building, and using drones with AI features for scientific projects and education.

Ein zweisprachiges Handbuch über Entwurf, Bau und Einsatz von KI-fähigen Drohnen für wissenschaftliche Projekte und Lehre.

There is still much to do. But it is a beginning.

We require this document for the hessian.AI, which funds our work, and it is useful for our students in the master's module AI-drones.

For convenience, I started with the German column. Translation makes only sense for parts that are considered good and final. Tables and Figures are done in English. 

Chapter 1 is more or less complete. Please give feedback. But remember: We don't want a comprehensive book. We focus on the hardware and software we really use in our projects. Completeness is not the aim of this handbook.
